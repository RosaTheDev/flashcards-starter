## Project Goals and Wins
- My goal was to have a deeper understanding on the class to class, calling upon different files and actually being able to test and manipulate the data, I found myself feeling really confident in putting together everything I learned from the previous Mod!
- I did a similar project in the BackEnd program using Ruby, I didn't end up finishing, the fact that I finished this one was a huge win!
